# This action will create a GitHub release as soon as a
# tag that starts with "v" is created. It will read the
# content of the file LATEST.md and append it to the
# release notes. This file is re-created each time a new
# release is done:
#
# npm run release
#   -> npm run changelog
#   -> delete LATEST.md
#   -> create LATEST.md from previous tag to current tag
#
# See configuration/release for more information.
